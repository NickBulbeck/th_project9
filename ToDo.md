Potential refactors:
1) Split the user and course routes up into seperate files
2) See if I can get the validations for PUT '/courses/:id' into a file like authenticateUser
3) Investigate the RESTAPI.postman_collection.json file and beef it up with more test cases
4) Investigate nodemon.json and see how to edit/play around with it - e.g. move it into the "start" script
