Potential refactors:
1) Split the user and course routes up into seperate files
2) See if I can get the validations for PUT '/courses/:id' into a file like authenticateUser
3) Investigate the RESTAPI.postman_collection.json file and beef it up with more test cases
4) Investigate nodemon.json and see how to edit/play around with it - e.g. move it into the "start" script
5) Tidy up the readme.md file

Friday:
1) Download starter files and make sure my seed files match up with the originals
2) Thence make sure all the given tests produce expected results
3) Thence maybe add some more that test my own additions
