Beginning of Project 9!

Learning points to set up and configure:
Sequelize:
https://teamtreehouse.com/library/using-sql-orms-with-nodejs/getting-started-with-sequelize/install-and-configure-sequelize-and-sqlite
... this is from the "Using SQL ORM's with Node.js" course, part 2 (Install and configure Sequelize and SQLite), from Unit 8. This covers the development of a project from scratch.

Need to go back further, though.
 - what files were downloaded with Unit 8?
 - what steps do I go through to create the models?
 - what does .authenticate() do, especially regarding synching?
 - Oh, and https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html is a great resource here: a complete list of stuff including setting up the models.
